To get started with AWS Lambda, use the Lambda console to create a function. 
In a few minutes, you can create a function, invoke it, and view logs, metrics, and trace data. 

You can author functions in the Lambda console â€” or with an IDE toolkit, command line tools, or SDKs. 
The Lambda console provides a code editor for noncompiled languages that lets you modify and test code quickly. 
The AWS CLI gives you direct access to the Lambda API for advanced configuration and automation use cases. 

In this Getting Started exercise you create a Lambda function using the AWS Lambda console. 
Next, you manually invoke the Lambda function using sample event data. 
AWS Lambda executes the Lambda function and returns results. 
You then verify execution results, including the logs that your Lambda function created and various 
CloudWatch metrics.
